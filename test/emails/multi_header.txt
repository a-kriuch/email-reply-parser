Hi XYZ,

Unfortunately, we are unable to add items to your order, but if you would like we can cancel your order and issue a full refund so that you may order again with your preferred selection of pastries. This may result in a later delivery date, but please let us know if you would like us to cancel your order and we will set that up for you.
